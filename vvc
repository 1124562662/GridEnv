The IEEE 4-bus, 34-bus and 123-bus distribution test feeders [46] are used in the numerical simulations.
 In the 4-bus feeder, a voltage regulator is located at node 1 and an on-load tap changer connects node 2 and 3.
 We add a capacitor bank with 200 kVar rating to node 4.
 In the 34-bus test feeder, a voltage regulator is at node 800.
 There are two transformers connecting node 814 to node 850 and node 852 to node 832 respectively.
 Two capacitors are placed at node 844 (100 kVar) and node 847 (150 kVar).
 In the 123-bus test feeder, a voltage regulator is at node 150.
 There are three on-load tap changers, which connect node 10 to node 15, node 160 to node 67, and node 25 to node 26 respectively.
 Four capacitors are placed at node 83 (200 kVar), node 88 (50 kVar), node 90 (50 kVar), and node 92 (50 kVar).
 All voltage regulators and on-load tap changers have 11 tap positions, which correspond to turns ratios ranging from 0.95 to 1.05.
  The capacitors can be switched on/off remotely and the number of ‘tap positions’ is treated as 2.

In the initial state, the turns ratios of voltage regulators and on-load tap changers are 1 and the capacitors are switched off.
The electricity price Ce is assumed to be $40/MWh . The operating cost per tap change CTj is set to be $0.1 for all devices.
One year of hourly smart meter energy consumption data [47] from London is used.
The aggregated load data is scaled and allocated to each node according to the existing spatial load distribution of the
IEEE standard test cases.
10 weeks of randomly selected data are used for out-of-sample testing.
The rest of the data are used for training purposes.
For DRL approaches, the reward and the cost are derived based on the line losses and nodal voltages calculated
from the power flow simulations.
For the three IEEE distribution test feeders, when the nodal voltages are within appropriate bounds, the line flow limits
 are also satisfied. Thus, only the voltage constraints are explicitly stated in the problem formulation. The upper limit
  for the number of voltage violations Vc¯¯¯¯¯¯ is set as 0.
The parameter settings for the reinforcement learning algorithms are provided in Table I below.
